I started my career with a Year in Industry, gaining hands on experience designing and manufacturing high quality aviation tooling with precise tolerances, and certifying these items using quality assurance techniques.

Although this led to high quality work, I felt that there was room to streamline the highly manual processes used to do this in order to get more out of the hard work put in.

Therefore, through my machine learning final year project, and subsequent freelance work, I borrowed the best practices and workflow techniques pioneered by the software industry to learn how to optimise day-to-day operations by reducing errors and improving time efficiency.

This includes comprehensive documentation of repeated tasks with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), automation with Scripts and custom User Interfaces, and Git version control with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

Building up this process layer of a business is what allows it to maintain the quality of its output as it scales operations, and is what builds real enterprise value. I now wish to take on an Engineering role in a company where I can use these skills to improve the throughput of myself and my team, and help the business grow while continuing my professional development as an engineer.
